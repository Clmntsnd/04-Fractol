    <h1>Welcome to the MLX42 migration documentation</h1>

## Why, How and What?
If you're considering to allow the usage of MLX42 in your campus and are wondering why you should do it, how should it work and what it will take to get it working, then this is the right spot!

---

### Why should I ?
MLX42 tackles one of the main problems in 42 in general. The degrading & outdating quality of the tools provided by 42. This includes the miniLibX library provided by the school to teach students very simple graphics programming.

The miniLibX is riddled with problems that have been lingering around for almost 20 years:
- `Non-maintained`: The library is practically dead, no one takes care of bugs or attempts into making it better.

- `Poor documentation`: The libraries documentation are a few silly `man` pages that haven't been updated for as well, 20 years. Its understandable that students need to learn on their own, however this is a library and actual open source software. Some sort of documentation is simply a must for anyone to start understanding any kind of software.

- `Poor execution`: There are multiple versions: `opengl`, `swift` & `X11`. Instead of becoming better each new iteration just either stays the same or becomes worse. A library should be future proof and not be dependent on a specific platform.

- `Non-Crossplatform`: Anyone can code on any machine, unless you use miniLibX. There are separate versions for each platform making it an absolute nightmare to work on both Linux, MacOS and Windows (or WSL2) at the same time.

This list could go on and on but it really just takes 1 project to not like the old miniLibX and think only about the negative parts about it.

MLX42 has been battle tested multiple times in Hackathons other campuses and has had over 500+ commits since 2021. All students share the same sentiment, they actually enjoy using the library yet do not find it too easy to finish the projects.

### How can I migrate ?
How can we "migrate" to MLX42? What are the necessary steps does one need to change subjects ?

---

### What is necessary to change ?
Nothing! It's that easy to switch to MLX42 from a pedagogical point of view.

---

## Core differences

- Rendering technique...
- Open-source / maintained
- Documented
- etc

## Subjects

- What needs to change (spoiler alert: Nothing)
